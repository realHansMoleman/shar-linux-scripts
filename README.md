# shar-linux-speedrun-scripts
**\*\*CURRENTLY WIP (and I am very lazy)\*\***

This is a repository for setting up SHAR (The Simpsons: Hit & Run) for Linux specifically for speedrunning. If you are interested in setting up the game and have no interest in speedrunning, check out [_Lucas Simpsons Hit and Run Mod Launcher Linux Launcher (lml-linux-launcher)_](https://gitlab.com/CodingKoopa/lml-linux-launcher) or use [_Lutris_](https://lutris.net/games/the-simpsons-hit-run/). _lml-linux-launcher_ is probably written far better than anything in here since I'm a novice at shell scripting (and I didn't even know it served a similar purpose until I set up this repository) so again I suggest checking that out for non-speedrunners.

These scripts *for now* won't install SHAR (and might never) but can be used to set up Wine prefixes for SHAR speedrunning, creating .desktop files and creating launch shell scripts.

Any contributions/suggestions are more than welcome.
